Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because:
  - Git is targeted at developers and there might be multiple changes across different files during new feature implementation
  - Google docs has is for simple document management and is not for developers
